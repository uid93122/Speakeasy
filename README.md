## 💡 Additional Information

Speakeasy processes all your speech locally. This means no internet, no cloud, and no data leaves your device. This approach protects your privacy better than online speech-to-text solutions.

The app’s technology is based on Whisper AI by OpenAI. Whisper AI is a research project designed to understand spoken language across many languages and contexts.

Thanks to Speakeasy’s local processing, you can transcribe sensitive or confidential conversations safely.

Speakeasy automatically saves your transcripts to a folder on your computer. By default, the location is:

- Windows: `Documents\Speakeasy Transcripts`
- macOS: `~/Documents/Speakeasy Transcripts`
- Linux: `~/Speakeasy Transcripts`

You can change this folder inside the app settings.
