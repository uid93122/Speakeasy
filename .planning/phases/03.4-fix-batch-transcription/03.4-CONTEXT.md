# Phase 03.4: Fix Batch Transcription - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Fix the critical backend error (`TranscriberService` attribute missing) and implement visual feedback for batch transcription status. The user must be able to see if a file failed and why.

## Implementation Decisions

### UI Feedback Style
- **Consistent with app:** Use existing UI patterns (likely status indicators in the file list and/or toast notifications) to communicate state.
- **Visibility:** Status must be visible per-file in the batch list.

### Error Detail Level
- **Specific errors:** Show the actual reason for failure (e.g., "Transcriber service error" or specific file issues) rather than a generic "Failed".
- **User-facing:** Technical logs belong in the backend console; UI should show readable but specific error messages.

### Retry Behavior
- **Auto-retry:** System attempts 1 automatic retry upon failure.
- **Manual action:** If the auto-retry fails, the item enters a "Failed" state.
- **Recovery:** User must clear the failed item and re-add it to try again (no infinite retry loops).

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact visual design of the error state (red text, icon, tooltip).
- Implementation of the auto-retry logic (immediate vs delayed).

## Specific Ideas

- "UI feedback to be consistent with the style of the rest of the app."
- "Specific error, Clear and re-add after 1 retry auto attempt."
